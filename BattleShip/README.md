# Battleship in Python

This is the Game of Battleship, Simulated on a GUI in Python.
The User Interface is Built using TKInter and the AI Bot uses a Probability based Method called "Hunt And Target". 


As of Now, The Functional Code simulates 2 AI bots running on different probability based Algorithms.

The Hunt and Target With Parity is slightly better than the one Without Parity and hence we can see that the Bot using that algorithm wins.
